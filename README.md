# Credit_Risk

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

Fast Lending, a P2P money lending service asked the team for a machine learning program to predist credit risk, and to help identify good candidates for loans. 

## Results:
Below, the six Machine Learning, or ML, models will be evaluated:
1. Logistics regression, uses an S curve to group
    Pros: great when there are two sides such as positive or negative, seems to be the easiest for a new coder such as myself
    Cons: easy to overfit/underfit, and not applicaple to most data sets
    
2. Decision Tree, a flow chart mixed with a for loop, following the path that best fits 
   Pros: easy to read, easy to identify where updates/fixes need to happen
   Cons: ugly (personal opinion), easy to overfit/underfit
   
4. Random Forest, 
   Pros: most used so lots of documentation and support online, 
   Cons: reduced over/under fitting, slow training, and can be biased 
   
6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   Pros:
   Cons:
   
8. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
   Pros:
   Cons:
   
10. Naive Bayes
   Pros:
   Cons:
