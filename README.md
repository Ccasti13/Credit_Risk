# Credit_Risk

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

Fast Lending, a P2P money lending service asked the team for a machine learning program to predist credit risk, and to help identify good candidates for loans. 

## Results:
Below, the six Machine Learning, or ML, models will be evaluated:
1. Logistics regression, uses an S curve to group
    Pros: great when there are two sides such as positive or negative, seems to be the easiest for a new coder such as myself
    Cons: easy to overfit/underfit, and not applicaple to most data sets
    
2. Decision Tree, a flow chart mixed with a for loop, following the path that best fits 
   Pros: easy to read, easy to identify where updates/fixes need to happen
   Cons: ugly (personal opinion), easy to overfit/underfit
   
4. Random Forest, multiple trees with a training data set
   Pros: most used so lots of documentation and support online, 
   Cons: reduced over/under fitting, slow training, and can be biased 
   
6. Support Vector Machine (SVM), classifies two-groups
   Pros: fast, does great with a clear division
   Cons: large data is too much for it
   
8. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), target shape to predict 
   Pros: no training, has different interior criteria, 
   Cons: has a hard time with outliers, slow
   
10. Naive Bayes, based on Bayesâ€™ predicting Theorem (P(A|B) =  P(A) P(B|A) / P(B))
   Pros: fast, binary and multi variables
   Cons: training (if something was not in the training, it's null),
